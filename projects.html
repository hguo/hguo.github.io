          <h3>Multidimensional Parameter-Space Feature Tracking, Analysis, and Visualization</h3>

          <p>Computational science, machine learning, and data analysis constantly advance and accelerate scientific discovery.  Scientific simulations, models, and analyses for such advances usually depend on parameters whose exact values require tuning.  A key challenge in such tuning is understanding how the outcome of a model changes with varying parameters and the sensitivity of each parameter. This research aims to establish a novel paradigm to help visualize and understand the outcomes of parameter changes by multidimensional parameter-space feature tracking. A generalization of traditional spacetime feature tracking, parameter-space feature tracking associates essential features such as extrema, vortex core lines, and boundary surfaces across multiple data instances induced by different input parameters.</p>

          <p>Specifically, we will research the tracking, analysis, and visualization of features across multidimensional parameter spaces. First, we will research mesh- and density-based methods for feature tracking in continuous and discrete parameter spaces. Second, we will research analysis algorithms to derive insights directly from multidimensional features. Third, we will investigate visualization methods to help enable parameter space exploration and understand multidimensional features. The proposed methodology will be applied to help understand ensemble simulations and machine learning models in Earth systems, fusion energy, and X-ray tomography applications.</p>

          <h3>Actionable Intelligent Visual Analytics of Ensembles</h3>

          <p>Ensemble simulations are needed in DOE science applications to understand model sensitivities and to quantify model uncertainties. Ensembles are a sparse sample of possible outcomes of simulation parameters, and the high volumes, velocities, and varieties of ensemble simulation outputs are a grand challenge for the comprehensive understanding of simulation parameter spaces. Driven by three DOE applications, namely Earth systems, energy systems, and cosmology, our research will consist of three tightly integrated pillars to increase understanding and utility of ensemble models, namely: visualization surrogates, variation models, and actionable visualization outlined below.</p>

          <p>Visualization surrogates will focus on creating AI models to relate the input parameter space to generated visualizations in image space, thus providing a comprehensive set of desirable future states. Such models will mitigate the high cost of executing full simulations for the visual analytics of parameter spaces. Specifically, we will research both image- and data-based surrogate models; the former directly predicts 2D visualization images, and the latter synthesize 3D grid/particle data for scenarios that require 3D interactions and feature extraction. The outcome of the models will allow interactive exploration and enable efficient sampling of the parameter space for deriving statistics and supporting decision-making.</p>

          <p>Variation models will derive principal characteristics of the simulation parameter spaces. The surrogate models will allow efficient sampling of the parameter space for characterizing and ranking the impact of individual parameters for the user-specified objectives. Methodologies developed in herein will suggest high-sensitive parameter(s), the direction(s) for parameter-tuning, and the confidence of the action based on existing samples.</p>

          <p>Actionable visualization will leverage surrogate and variation models to establish an actionable paradigm for human-in-the-loop decision-making for optimizing input parameters. Specifically, it will bridge parameter space and decision space through the visualizations and features derived using visualization surrogates and variation modeling by translating principal characteristics into interactive visual metaphors. Rather than computing expensive inverse models from decision space back to parameter space, we will store the mapping between parameter space and decision space and use human-guided interactive visual exploration to enable understandable and actionable decision making.</p>

          <h3>Collaborative Research: III: Medium: Deep Learning for In Situ Analysis and Visualization</h3>

          <p>As scientists anticipate the benefits of exascale computing, the lack of novel solutions to process data at scale and calibrate the simulation parameters has become a significant roadblock to further accelerating scientific discovery. The goal of this project is to develop a new end-to-end data analysis and feature extraction workflow based on deep neural networks to help computational scientists address three major challenges: (1) identify important simulation parameters and generate the essential data for analysis, (2) transform the simulation data to compact feature representations to convey the most insight, and (3) design scalable visualization algorithms coupled with large-scale simulations to glean insight into their scientific problems. Working with domain scientists in jet engine design, climate models, cardio/cerebrovascular flow, superconductivity, and fusion energy, the team will demonstrate how deep learning techniques can help extract features from vast amounts of simulation data and navigate in the huge simulation parameter space. Through summer internships and project collaborations, this research will create opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, to participate in key research initiatives with leading scientists. Through the planned annual summer school on "Deep Learning for Visualization," the research results will enable visualization researchers and a broader community to incorporate the principles and practice of deep learning techniques developed.</p>

          <h3>CODAR: A Co-design Center for Online Data Analysis and Reduction at the Exascale</h3>

          <p>The growing disparity between the size of simulation output and I/O rates makes it imperative for applications to be able to subset, compress, extract features, and analyze results at runtime. Hence, exascale systems will be increasingly used for computations that involve more than a single simulation, such as data assimilation, calibration, and uncertainty quantification. CODAR is a co-design center focused on online data analysis and reduction at the exascale that includes approximation, reduction, assimilation, calibration, data mining, and statistical analysis.</p>

          <h3>Visual Analytics for Large Scale Scientific Ensemble Datasets</h3>

          <p>Ensembles are collections of data produced by simulations or experiments conducted with different initial conditions, parameterizations, or phenomenological models. The goal of this project is to develop visual analytic techniques for large scale scientific ensemble data sets. We are tackling the problem of large scale ensemble data analysis and visualization from four unique perspectives: (1) exploration of local uncertainty with distributions, (2) exploration and tracking of ensemble features, (3) exploration of multivariate ensemble parameters, and (4) automation of in situ ensemble analytics.</p>

          <h3>Neuromorphic Computing for Feature Extracting and Tracking</h3>

          <p>In the Post-Moore era, as gap increases between the data production rates and available I/O bandwidth, online feature extraction makes it possible to derive insights during scientific simulations and thus reduce data to be stored.  The purpose of this study is to explore and develop feature extraction and tracking algorithms in the context of neuromorphic architectures, which are biologically inspired and superior to von Neumann architecture in energy efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance.</p>
